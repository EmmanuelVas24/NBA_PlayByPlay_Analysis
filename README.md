In this project, I will be analysing shot logs from 2013-2019 in the NBA. I have obtained ‘Play by Play’ data for every game between 2013-2019. Every shot taken in the game is recorded, with a few other details; for example, who took the shot, shot type, whether it was made or missed, how many points its worth, x and y locations, etc.

The code for this project can be found in "Play_By_Play_2018-2019.R"
Explanations can be found in "NBA_Presentation.pptx" and "Tracking NBA shots.docx"
